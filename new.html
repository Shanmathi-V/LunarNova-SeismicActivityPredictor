    <h1>TYPES OF SEISMIC WAVES</h1>

    <p class="t1">
      <b>1. P-Waves (Primary Waves):</b><br><br>
      <b>Characteristics:</b> P-waves, or primary waves, are the fastest type of seismic waves, traveling at speeds of approximately 5 to 8 kilometers per second in the Earth's crust. They are longitudinal waves, meaning that the particle motion occurs in the same direction as the wave propagation. As a result, P-waves compress and expand the material they pass through, similar to sound waves in the air.
      <br><br>
      <b>Propagation:</b> P-waves can travel through solids, liquids, and gases, making them the first waves detected by seismographs after an earthquake. Their ability to traverse both solid and fluid mediums allows seismologists to infer the internal structure of the Earth, particularly the existence of liquid layers such as the outer core.
      <br><br>
      <b>Detection and Significance:</b> Because of their speed, P-waves arrive first at seismic monitoring stations. The time difference between the arrival of P-waves and subsequent waves (S-waves and surface waves) provides critical information for estimating the distance to the earthquake's epicenter. Understanding P-waves is essential for earthquake preparedness and response strategies.
    </p>

    <p class="t2">
      <b>2. S-Waves (Secondary Waves):</b><br><br>
      <b>Characteristics:</b> S-waves, or secondary waves, are slower than P-waves, traveling at speeds of about 3 to 4.5 kilometers per second. They are transverse waves, which means that the particle motion is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. S-waves cause shear deformation in the material, resulting in a side-to-side or up-and-down motion.
      <br><br>
      <b>Propagation:</b> Unlike P-waves, S-waves can only travel through solid materials and cannot propagate through fluids (liquids and gases). This characteristic is critical in understanding the Earth's inner structure. The inability of S-waves to pass through the outer core is evidence of its liquid state.
      <br><br>
      <b>Detection and Significance:</b> S-waves arrive at seismic monitoring stations after P-waves, providing valuable information about the earthquake's location and depth. The absence of S-waves in certain regions can indicate the presence of liquid layers within the Earth. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the geological features beneath the Earth’s surface.
    </p>

    <p class="t3">
      <b>3. Surface Waves:</b><br><br>
      <b>Characteristics:</b> Surface waves travel along the Earth’s exterior and are typically slower than both P-waves and S-waves. They consist of two main types: Love waves and Rayleigh waves. Love waves cause horizontal shear, moving the ground side-to-side, while Rayleigh waves produce an elliptical motion, similar to ocean waves, resulting in both vertical and horizontal ground displacement.
      <br><br>
      <b>Propagation:</b> Surface waves generally travel slower than P-waves and S-waves, but they are responsible for most of the damage during an earthquake due to their larger amplitudes and longer duration. They primarily affect the Earth's surface, causing ground shaking that can lead to structural damage.
      <br><br>
      <b>Detection and Significance:</b> Surface waves are detected after both P-waves and S-waves and are crucial for understanding the impact of seismic events on human structures. Their analysis helps engineers and architects design buildings and infrastructure that can withstand the effects of earthquakes.
